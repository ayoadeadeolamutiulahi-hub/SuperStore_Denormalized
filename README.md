The SuperStore Sales dataset comprises total sales, profits, and quantities sold for various items within an organization over a three-year period.
A dashboard was developed to visualize the following aspects:
- Total Order
- The segment in which the sales are going through at an average rate
- The range of orders for each sales team Manager
- The range of each region that purchases the most
- The category from which most orders came
- Profit made by each segment
- Trends of order over sales
